* I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan, where I am fortunately advised by Professor *[Xinyu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/)*. I studied in University of Washington and was lucky to work with Professor *[Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/)*, and Dr. *[Chenglong Wang](https://chenglongwang.org/)* on program synthesis in data science.

* **Research**: 
My interest lies in a cross-descipline of Programming Language, Deep Learning, and Human-centered Design. In particular, I am interested in **program synthesis** (also known as code generation), where we design algorithm and AI powered tool to help end-users solve challenging problems in various domains such as automation and data science. I believe the future development of these tools need to be powerful but also reliable and easy-to-use to various users.

* Recently, I'm actively working in the domain of web automation, where end users could automate  online task procedure through interactively demonstration.
