I'm a first-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan, where I am fortunately advised by Professor *[Xinyu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/)*.

A short while ago, I studied in University of Washington as an undergraduate student and was lucky to work with Professor *[Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/)*, and Dr. *[Chenglong Wang](https://chenglongwang.org/)* on applying program synthesis in data science.

I am interested in exploring AI and program synthesis-powered interactive tools that can help end-user program in various domains.
