* I'm in my 3rd-year as Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by Professor [Xinyu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~xwangsd/). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at University of Washington, where I luckily worked with  Dr. [Chenglong Wang](https://chenglongwang.org/) and Professor [Rastislav Bodik](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/).

* **Research**: 
My interest lies in a cross-descipline of Programming Language, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-centered Design. In particular, I am interested in building intelligent tools that boost efficiency and democratize technology for end-user in various domains.
